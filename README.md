# Thread-Synchronization-Operating-Systems-
Project on Thread Synchronization (Ticket Booking System)


To develop a multi-threaded ticket booking system in C that simulates multiple users booking seats simultaneously, using semaphores to handle synchronization and prevent race conditions, ensuring that no two users can book the same seat at the same time.
